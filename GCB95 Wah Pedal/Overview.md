This is for a mod to gcb95 crybaby pedal.

The guitar pedal that is modded is found here:

The pedal itself is known to be what is 'non true bypass' meaning that when the pedal is off, a buffer circuit inside, is still engaged causing 
what is known as 'tone suck' to a guitar pedal chain. A pedal chain is just a series of guitar pedals connected together that work to create
a unique sound for the effects that a guitar player will created when connected to it. A common mod is known as a'true bypass' mod. This mod 
essentially includes skipping this buffer circuit or 'bypassing' it, so that the signal in the guitar effect chain goes directly from pedal 
input to output, thus not allowing any of the buffer circuit to influence the rest of the guitar pedal chain when the pedal is turned off.
