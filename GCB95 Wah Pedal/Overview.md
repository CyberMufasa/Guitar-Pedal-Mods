This project is to mod a gcb95 crybaby pedal.

The guitar pedal is found [here](https://www.long-mcquade.com/123/Guitars/Guitar-Effects/Dunlop/Original-Cry-Baby-Wah.htm). There a numerous sources online that can explain what this pedal is, so read those if interested as this project is not meant to cover that information. Instead this will cover modifications being made to this pedal.

The pedal itself has a circuit incorporated that is 'non true bypass' meaning that when the pedal is off, a buffer circuit inside is still connected between the circuit input and output causing what is known as 'tone suck' to a guitar pedal chain. A pedal chain is just a series of guitar pedals connected together that work to create
a unique sound for the effects that a guitar player will create when connected to it. Tone suck is bad as it means that even when a pedal is turned
off, part of the guitar sound will be affected by the pedal, and sometimes causes the overall sound to not be what is desired simply from having this
circuit present in the chain.

A common mod is known as a'true bypass' mod. This mod essentially skips this buffer circuit or 'bypasses' it, so that the signal in the guitar effect chain goes directly from pedal input to output, thus not allowing any of the buffer circuit to influence the rest of the guitar pedal chain when the pedal is turned off.

This was one of the mods done to the pedal. Another mod was to change the effect type of the pedal iteself. The gcb95 is a wah pedal but a simple cicuit modifcation transforms it into a volume pedal instead. A wah pedal is basically and envelope filter effect the gives a guitar a funky sound, like what Jimi Hendrix would often use. A volume pedal is much more simple, as the name suggests, it adjusts the volume of the signal chain. Both these effects serve their purpose so there is a desire to have the ability to use both of them.

The mods done are:
- True Bypass
- Volume/Wah combination
- (To be done later) Toggle switch between buffered (non True Bypass) and unbuffered (True Bypass)
